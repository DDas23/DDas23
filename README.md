## **hypnotic spaghettification**
I am here to dive deeper into the cosmos of coding, something that doesn't meet the eye, which can only be felt. Its like an unfathomable power that is endless, where it can solve demanding world problems, give power to the powerless, answer the most intriguing questions or simply create something beautiful!

**'hypnotic spaghettification'** is what my type of coding aims for. Its a culmination of strange attraction like hypnosis and a strong gravity like effect which pulls you and shreads your senses like spaghetti. 

Here, I want to take you one step further than just science, a place where science takes the form of magic!
